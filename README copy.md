## About Project

A simple TO-Do List built with Webpack. It allows user to add tasks to the list, remove tasks from the list, reposition tasks on the list and even delete task from the list.

I have attempeted to implement the MVC framework with this project as a learning undertaking. Thus, code has been separate into models, views, and controllers directories.
